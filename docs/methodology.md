# Benchmark Methodology

To ensure fair and transparent results, Nebula Media follows a strict benchmarking protocol.

## 1. Datasets
Benchmarks use well-known public test media (e.g., Jellyfish, Blender Open Movies) to allow for third-party verification.

## 2. Metrics
*   **VMAF (Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion):** For objective perceptual video quality.
*   **File Size:** Total storage footprint.
*   **Subjective Analysis:** Notes on motion detail and texture preservation.

## 3. Environment
Benchmarks are run on high-performance infrastructure (CPU/GPU class disclosed in specific results).

## 4. Disclaimers
**Benchmark results are content-dependent and provided for transparency. They do not represent universal guarantees or worst-case performance. Production results vary based on content characteristics and deployment configuration.**

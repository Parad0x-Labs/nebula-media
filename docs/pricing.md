# Nebula Media Pricing

Nebula Media is the media optimization pillar of Parad0x Labs.

## Public Access (Free)

Nebula Media is free to use via the public web interface on parad0xlabs.com for creators, developers, and small teams.

This includes:
- Standard media optimization workflows (video / image / audio)
- Public benchmark documentation
- Verification tooling and methodology

## Enterprise Plans (Custom)

Organizations that require scale, control, or operational guarantees can adopt Nebula Media under a custom plan.

Enterprise plans typically cover:
- Usage-based throughput (large batch processing / sustained volume)
- Dedicated deployments (private cloud / on-prem / air-gapped)
- SLAs and priority support
- Compliance and audit support (data residency, security review readiness)
- Workflow customization and integration support

**Enterprise pricing is usage-based and deployment-dependent.**

# Technical Overview

## The Problem: Media Bloat & Bandwidth Costs
As visual data (4K/8K video, high-res images) dominates infrastructure traffic, storage and egress costs scale linearly with quality. Traditional compression often forces a choice between "visual integrity" and "bitrate efficiency."

## The Approach: Quality-Per-Bit Optimization
Nebula Media treats media compression as an optimization pipeline, not just a codec. By leveraging modern standards (AV1, AVIF, Opus) and deterministic packaging, we focus on:
*   **Maximized Fidelity:** Preserving texture and motion detail at lower bitrates.
*   **Deterministic Conduction:** Consistent quality across varying source complexities.
*   **Verified Locally:** Providing the tools to prove quality scores (VMAF/SSIM) locally.

## Alignment
Nebula Media is the visual conduction pillar of Parad0x Labs, perfectly complementing the **Liquefy** data engine and the **$NULL** Sovereign OS vision.

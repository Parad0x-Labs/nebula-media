# Nebula Media — Enterprise One-Pager

## Quality-Per-Bit Media Optimization for Modern Infrastructure

Nebula Media is the media optimization pillar of Parad0x Labs. It delivers high-efficiency video, image, and audio pipelines focused on **quality-per-bit**, **deterministic processing**, and **offline verification**.

## The Problem
- Bandwidth and storage costs continue to rise
- Encoding quality is often traded for speed or cost
- Benchmark claims are frequently opaque and difficult to verify
- Enterprises need predictable, auditable pipelines

## The Approach
Nebula Media is not a codec. It is a **pipeline and orchestration layer** built on modern standards (AV1, AVIF, Opus), designed to improve quality-per-bit across real-world workflows.

## Key Capabilities
- High-efficiency media pipelines (video / image / audio)
- Benchmark-driven optimization
- Deterministic, repeatable outputs
- Offline verification and reproducible methodology
- Standards-based formats (no proprietary lock-in)

## Verification & Trust
- Public benchmark documentation
- VMAF-based evaluation for video where applicable
- Input/output references published for inspection
- Local verification tools available

## Deployment Models
- Public web interface (free)
- Dedicated cloud deployment
- On-prem / private cloud
- Air-gapped environments

## Licensing
- Public usage: free
- Enterprise usage: custom plans based on scale and deployment

Nebula Media separates **media optimization workflows** from **operational delivery**, enabling enterprise scale without sacrificing transparency.

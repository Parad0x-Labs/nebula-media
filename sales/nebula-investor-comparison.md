# Nebula Media — Investor-Safe Comparison (Slide Copy)

## Media Encoding Landscape (High-Level)

| Approach | Primary Focus | Typical Limitations |
|---|---|---|
| x264 | Speed / compatibility | Lower efficiency vs modern standards |
| x265 (HEVC) | Better compression | Licensing complexity, slower workflows |
| Public AV1 presets | Modern standard | Generic tuning, variable results by content |
| Nebula Media | Quality-per-bit pipelines | Requires orchestration layer and workflow integration |

## What Nebula Media Does Differently

| Dimension | Traditional Tools | Nebula Media |
|---|---|---|
| Codec | Encoder-centric | Standards-based pipelines |
| Optimization | Static presets | Pipeline-level optimization |
| Benchmarking | Often opaque | Public methodology and verification support |
| Verification | Rare | Offline verification supported |
| Deployment | Tool-centric | Infrastructure-centric deployments |

## Key Takeaway (Bottom Line)

Nebula Media does not replace codecs — it orchestrates standards-based workflows to deliver consistently improved quality-per-bit across real-world workloads.

*Results vary by content characteristics and deployment configuration.*

## Description
**Nebula Media** is the media optimization pillar of Parad0x Labs. It provides benchmark-driven pipelines, adapters, and verification tools for video, image, and audio compression — designed for quality-per-bit efficiency, offline verification, and enterprise deployment.

## 📂 What This Repo Contains
*   **Media processing pipelines:** Example structures for video, image, and audio conduction.
*   **Public benchmarks:** Validated results on well-known test media (e.g., Jellyfish).
*   **Verification tooling:** Scripts for local inspection and quality checks.
*   **Reproducible methodology:** Standardized protocols for performance verification.

## 🚫 What This Repo Does NOT Contain
*   **Proprietary encoder tuning:** Secret AQ modes, psychovisual knobs, and RC internals are excluded.
*   **Production AV1 kernels:** Optimized conduction kernels are not public.
*   **Psychovisual heuristics:** Specialized neural scoring models are protected.
*   **GPU-level optimizations:** Low-level hardware acceleration code is restricted.

**Important:** This repository demonstrates usage, benchmarking, and verification. Production encoder tuning and kernels are delivered via licensed binaries or managed services.

## 🔑 Key Principles
*   **Sealed Decoder Appliance:** Production-grade media optimization is delivered via hardened, "Blackbox" binaries for local verification.
*   **Offline verification:** Proving quality locally without cloud dependency.
*   **Deterministic pipelines:** Ensuring consistent results across deployments.
*   **Standards-based formats:** Using AV1, AVIF, and Opus for maximum compatibility.
*   **IP-protected production engines:** Keeping the "Secret Sauce" sealed while proving the "Proof".

---

## 🛡️ Security & Trust
*   **Local Restoration:** All Nebula Media archives can be restored locally using our sealed decoders.
*   **Zero-Data Leakage:** The appliance supports `--network=none` for air-gapped security.
*   **Quality Proof:** Independent verification of VMAF and SSIM metrics on your own infrastructure.
